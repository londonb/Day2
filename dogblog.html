    <h3>New Year's Resolutions</h3>
    <p>I am a dog, so I don't know what these are or even what time of year it is. I'm so <em>old</em>. Or am I? I don't know. What are your resolutions? Send me a message. But you can't, because I am a dog.</p>
    <p>Blog Post 1: Possible resolutions for non-dogs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Much healthy</li>
      <li>Finally do that thing</li>
      <li>Walk dog. Walk dog. Walk dog.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Those are my suggestions. You should take them. Especially #3.</p>
